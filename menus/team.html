        This page is designed to help a team understand how quickly they are moving work through the pipeline. The main summary table reports statistics such as throughput and average cycle time for stories, CV defects, and non-CV defects. The bubble chart visualizes each artifact that was released during the quarter, showing their release date, cycle time, and plan estimate. Finally, the cumulative flow chart visualizes the rate at which artifacts move across the kanban.
